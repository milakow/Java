/**
 * Create an interface named Fillable with a method fill().
 * Implement this method in the 3DShape class from the previous task or separately in the Cone and Qube classes.
 * The fill() method should take an int parameter and return true/false if water was added successfully, check if, after filling the shape with water:
 * • It will overflow if too much water is poured into the shape.
 * • The shape will be filled with water up to the brim if the amount of water is just enough.
 * • It will be under-filled if too little water is poured.
 * For each situation, the method should print a message to the console about the current state. Use the calculateVolume() method to determine the capacity of the shape.
