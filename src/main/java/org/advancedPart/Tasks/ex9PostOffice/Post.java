 * Add a method that will allow us to send packages.
 * The method is supposed to require you to hand over a package and an amount of money.
 * The method accepting the package should check its price, and if enough money has been paid, it should change package status to "shipped" and return the rest.
 * If there was not enough money, return them all and donâ€™t modify the condition of the package.
 * Add the "takings" field to the post and add the money earned by the post to it.
